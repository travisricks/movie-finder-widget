# Hello COMVEX!

I had a lot of fun building this project. And I'm looking forward to meeting with you to discuss it.

## Running the project locally

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts:

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `yarn start`

Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

#### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

## Features included:

- All minimum requirements for COMVEX completed.
- Initial load of app displays 'trending items' from the API so the app has content on page load.
- Added user feedback when invalid input is used for search to help users use the app.
- Trimmed long descriptions/biographies to keep the design clean
- Added lazy loading for images to improve performance.
- Created a favicon from the logo to be consistent with the site's branding.
- Added fallback images when no image returns from DB to keep the design clean.
- Created a new svg of the logo to fix a centering issue if the font was missing to ensure logo displays correctly on all machines.

## Ideas for next sprint:

- Add styling for responsive sizing
- Add tests
- Add support for multiple images per item
