## Running the project locally

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts:

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `yarn start`

Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

#### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
